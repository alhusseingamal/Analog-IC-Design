## Analog-IC-Design
This is a collection of my own solutions to Labs and projects related to the field of Electronic Circuit Design and Analog IC Design.

The Labs included are either part of my college work, or external courses, mainly the CMOS Analog IC Design course offered by MasterMicro Inc. under the supervision of the well-known Dr. Hesham Omran and sponsorship of the ITI (Information technology Institute).

Reports are available with graphic and tabular plots, schematic snipppets and full explanations.

Schematic files and model libraries used will be uploaded soon.

I will be updating this repo frequently in the short-run time, so watch out if you are interested.
